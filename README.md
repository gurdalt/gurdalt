- 👋 Hi, I’m Gurdal Tugay
- 👀 10 years experienced aeronautical engineer who loves to build business intelligence dashboards to provide data-driven decisions.
- 🌱 Right now, I am working on improving my skills on ETL and ELT Data pipelines (Airflow), Data modelling (Postgres and Apache Cassandra) and Cloud computing (AWS Redshift, Spark) in addition to my skills on Python, SQL, pandas, data visualizations (Tableau, PowerBI, Spotfire).
- 💞️ I would like to leverage my past experience, ability to lead, motivate and confident way of project management skills with lean six sigma tools to next level in Data Scientist, Operations/Business Analyst or Project Manager. I could quickly learn and master new technology; equally successful in both team and self-directed settings.
